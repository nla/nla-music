nla-music
=========

An iPad app to explore the National Library's digital collection of sheet music.


Dependencies
============

This app uses [Nimbus](http://nimbuskit.info) which in turn uses AFNetworking and 
JSONKit (though as this app is iOS6 only, JSONKit isn't actually used at runtime).

Before you can complie and run this app, you'll need to make sure you've got all of
these dependencies. They've been added to this project as git submodules, so be sure
to use the --recursive option when you clone this project to make sure you also get
all the submodules:

git clone --recursive https://github.com/nla/nla-music.git
